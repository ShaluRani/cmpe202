In Lab1, the gumball machine implementation for different configurations was achieved by subclassing the main gumball machine class. Three new machines were built for three different scenarios.

In Lab10, featureIDE AND AspectJ made it quite simpler to achieve a similar solution as that of Lab1 and that too with just one gumball machine class. The different configurations were handled using default.config settings, wherein we can input the different scenarios via config selections. This version of code can accomodate future changes in amount, slots or any other criteria quite easily without much overhead.

Below are the screenshots of the outputs generated using featureIDE and aspectJ:
